               <p> Health earlier was stated as ‘the ability of a well-functioning .’ However, with time, definitions of health changed. The state of being healthy doesn’t necessarily mean physical fitness but refers to overall health fitness, which is emotional, mental, and social stability. Good health is the real wealth.

                The World Health Organisation commemorates the World Health Day celebration every year on April 7,  to create awareness among people about health and cleanliness.
                
                A healthy body holds major components that aid the functioning of the body. The first essential component is the state of physical health. Physical health refers to the state of being physically healthy devoid of any illness or diseases. When one maintains good physical fitness, they tend to have an extended lifespan. The best way to maintain physical well-being is through a balanced diet. Intake of essential nutrients in appropriate quantities helps one manage their physical health.

                The next essential component is everyday exercise. To help the body maintain it’s physical fitness, one must never forget to exercise, even if it’s for ten minimum minutes. It is not advisable to consume junk food all the time. Do not drink alcohol or smoke as it is a hazard to one’s health. Lastly, try to take adequate sleep ( 7-8 hours) regularly over the use of the phone. It is best advised to not use the phone two hours before sleep.
                
                The next health component is mental health or mental well-being. Mental health refers to a state of emotional and psychological well-being of the individual. A person’s mental well-being impacts their emotions and behavior in handling situations. The best-recommended way to maintain mental health is by staying positive and meditating.

              <p>  Subsequently, cognitive and social health add equal importance to a person’s overall well-being state. A person maintains their social well-being through effective communication with other people. A person who attends social gatherings and possesses a friendly nature is stated to be socially healthy. Similarly, one’s cognitive health refers to the regular performance of mental processes leading to an effective state of health. To achieve that, one must consume healthy food and play brain boosters such as puzzles, riddles, chess, etc. This helps one to sharpen their brains.
                
                A healthy body is a sign of a healthy mind, while unhealthy body weakness one’s ability to succeed and excel in life. However, there is this stigma about mental health. To be healthy also include mental health, but people do not consider mental disorders as an issue. Psychological well-being is as equally important as physical well-being. When people criticize mental illness, it instantly creates an adverse impact.
                
                
                 
                Parents often concentrate only on their children’s physical needs. They dress up wounds and injuries and feed their kids with nutritious food. However, they often fail to notice the crumbling mental health of their child. This is because they do not think mental health is essential. Even among elders, one fails to see their psychological well-being. It is due to a lack of awareness among people.
                
                Therefore, one must be able to identify the signs regarding mental illness. A laughing person is not always a happy person. Never brush off mental illness as a taboo, instead pay attention and save people’s life.
                
                As Mahatma Gandhi quoted, ‘ Health is the real wealth'</p>
